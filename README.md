连续7年地图网格计算一阶导数和二阶导数计算，以及对应p值显著性计算，并进行地图显示
## Describe
The first and second derivatives of the China’s plantation area change from 1990 to 2020 are estimated by linear and power fitting, respectively. Primary, quadratic coefficients and their significance are calculated at the spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 km2 per 5 years, and are log-transformed for mapping. Black dots indicate that the changes are statistically significant (t-test, p < 0.05) for more than half of the 50 * 50-km2 grid area. The statistics are implemented by R v. 4.2.1 (http://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio 2022.07.2+576 (http://www.rstudio.com/), and visualization is produced by ArcGIS v. 10.6 (http://www.arcgis.com, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA).
